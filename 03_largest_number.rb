# Write a method that will take two numbers,
# and return whichever is the largest.
#
# Example:
# largest_number(100,50) should return 100
# largest_number(10,20) should return 20
#
# Check your solution by filling in the folowing table:
# number_1 || number_2 || expected || actual
# 
# If your stuck try working togeather

# Beast Mode:
# If you complete the challenge, feel free to come up
# with your own examples and test corner cases.

# Examples - what if both numbers are equal or are strings?
